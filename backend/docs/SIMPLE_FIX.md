# 🎯 SIMPLE FIX - Just Run This!

## ⚡ ONE COMMAND TO FIX EVERYTHING

```powershell
cd backend
.\fix_everything.ps1
```

**That's it!** This script will:
1. ✅ Fix HOST configuration (0.0.0.0)
2. ✅ Disable auto-migrations (already in database)
3. ✅ Clean and rebuild backend
4. ✅ Start the server

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

When the backend starts, you should see:

```
INFO CORS allowed origins: ["http://localhost:5173", ...]
INFO Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

✅ **If you see `0.0.0.0:8080` - IT WORKED!**

❌ **If you see `127.0.0.1:8080` - RUN THE SCRIPT AGAIN**

---

## 🚀 Then Test in Browser

### Open Another Terminal:
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Open Browser:
http://localhost:5173

### Register:
- First Name: John
- Last Name: Doe
- Email: test@test.com
- Password: Test123!
- Date of Birth: 2000-01-01
- ✅ Accept terms
- Confirm age verification

### ✅ SUCCESS = Redirected to Dashboard!
